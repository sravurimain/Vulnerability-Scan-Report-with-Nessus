# Vulnerability Scan Report with Nessus
This project demonstrates the use of Tenable Nessus for conducting comprehensive vulnerability scans. Nessus is a widely-used vulnerability assessment tool that helps identify security vulnerabilities, configuration issues, and malware that may affect your systems or networks.

## Tool Used
- **Tenable Nessus**

## Environment
- Nessus Essentials
- Target network or systems (with explicit permission)
- Web browser to access Nessus interface

## Basic Usage
1. Log in to Nessus web interface
2. Create a new scan
3. Configure scan settings
4. Launch the scan
5. Analyze results

## Common Scan Types
1. **Basic Network Scan**
   - Discovers live hosts and open ports
   - Identifies operating systems and services

2. **Credentialed Scan**
   - Performs in-depth checks using provided credentials
   - Identifies missing patches and misconfigurations

3. **Web Application Scan**
   - Focuses on web-specific vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS)

4. **Compliance Scan**
   - Checks against specific compliance standards (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA)

5. **Malware Scan**
   - Looks for signs of malware infection

## Example Outputs

## Key Features of Nessus Reports
- Risk-based scoring of vulnerabilities
- Detailed descriptions of each finding
- Remediation steps and recommendations
- Ability to generate custom reports
- Trend analysis for tracking security posture over time

## Safety and Legal Considerations
- Always obtain explicit permission before scanning networks or systems you do not own or manage
- Be aware that some scan types may be intrusive and could potentially disrupt services
- Handle scan results with care, as they contain sensitive information about your network's security posture
